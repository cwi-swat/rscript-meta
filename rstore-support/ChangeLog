 * Bumped version.

2008-11-27  Tijs van der Storm  <tvdstorm@MacSen1.local>

  * lib/lower.c: removed dependency on BUFSIZ (it's too small on
    Darwin); replaced with Linux sized constant.

Fri Aug 29 14:33:23 CEST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * utils/{lift,lower}-rstore/main.c: adapted output format to output
   ATerm SAF format for compatibility with Java ATerm tools.
 * lib/lower.c: improved error handling of lowering by printing erroneous
   terms to a debug file and printing a readable message.

Mon Jun  9 13:25:48 CEST 2008 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * rstore-support.pc.in: Bumped version to 0.2

Wed May  7 13:12:43 2008    <bruntink@cwi.nl>

	* relation-stores.pc.in: Renamed to rstore-support.pc.in and changed names.

Tue Jan 22 16:47:05 CET 2008 <economop@cwi.nl>
 * lib/**: regenerated apis with the rejected production removed from
   basic/RStores.sdf.

Wed Aug 22 12:45:09 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * utils/lift-rstore/*: added lift-rtuple functionality

Wed Aug 15 10:57:24 CEST 2007 <kooiker@cwi.nl>
 * lib/lift.c: made robust lifting of RStores. The illegal parts of an RStore
   are replaced by default values, and a message is printed on the console.

Thu Apr 12 20:24:45 CEST 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/lower.c: made lowering robust against RStores containing more 
   than just RStore syntax (i.e. unreduced functions). The illegal parts
   of an RStore are replaced by default values, and a message is printed
   on the console.

Wed Mar 21 13:04:59 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * utils/lower-rstore: made a ToolBus tool out of it, and made robust
   against input from Start constructors, or RStores directly.

Tue Mar 13 12:17:11 CET 2007 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * lib/lower.c: added mapping from parsed rstores to ATerm rstores.
 * lib/**: regenerated apis with new apigen
 * utils/lower-rstore: added commandline tool for lowering RSTores

2007-02-12    <{kooiker,storm}@cwi.nl>
	* Moved to new build-environment.

2006-12-15    <storm@cwi.nl>
	* Fix: the relationstores.jar wasn't under svn. Now it is.

2006-12-14    <storm@cwi.nl>
	* lib/Makefile.am (java-api): enabled this target and regenerated
	API after name-clashes were fixed in the RStores grammar.

	* Fix: fixed Makefile.am to accomodate new RStore
	syntax. Regenerated the API accordingly.

Wed Feb 15 17:01:40 CET 2006 <jurgenv@cwi.nl>
 * Initial empty package. Will contain the data API of RStores,
   a generic representation format for typed relational data and
   such.
